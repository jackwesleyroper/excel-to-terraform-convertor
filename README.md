# Excel to Terraform Converter

This script will convert excel spreadsheets containing variables in the format of the examples included in this repository into Terraform HCL formatted configuration files. Included as an example is the foundations.xlsx spreedsheet you can use as a demo.

The script takes colours from the spreadsheet to denote how the output should be formatted, see comments in convertor.py for more info.

To run the script:
1. Install python 3 
2. Install the openpyxl module - 'pip install openpyxl'
3. Run 'python3 Converter.py <filename>.xlsx' (or 'python .\Convertor.py <filename>.py' on windows.
  
Enjoy!
